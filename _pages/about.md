I am an Associate Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at University at Buffalo, State University of New York. Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in EECS at Harvard from 2010-13. I received my M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Southern California in 2010.

My research interests are in algorithmic and systems challenges in Robot Autonomy. Broadly, my group works on topics in robot perception and coordination.
